### RBAC

RBAC i an access control provider that gives you the possiblity to map users and groups to roles(administrator, Monitor,etc). The Default "simple" access control don't permit that. 

Before Activating RBAC, Give Administrator authorization to admin user, else the console will be no longer accessible by this user :

	/core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Administrator:add
	/core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Administrator/include=user-jbossadmin:add(name=jbossadmin,type=USER)

RBAC roles:
- Administrator
- Monitor
- Deployer
- Maintainer
- etc

Switching To the RBAC Provider:

	/core-service=management/access=authorization:write-attribute(name=provider,value=rbac)
	reload

Create Users: 

Use Console : Heading 'Access Control'. Password is named Realm.
