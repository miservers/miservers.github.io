- WebSphere MQ Queues reside in, and are managed by, a queue manager. Programs access queues via the services provided by the queue manager.
- Queue managers are the MQ servers that host the queues.

- History
MQ series 1993
Websphere MQ 2002
IBM MQ 2014

- Do NOT use the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel. Create a new one (i.e. MY.APPL.CHL) and use it

------
- Clients
2 programming models. 
• MQI (MQCONN  MQCONNX MQDISC MQOPEN  MQCLOSE MQSUB MQPUT  MQPUT1 MQGET MQCB  MQCTL...)
• JMS (for non-Java languages use XMS)

- Each remotely connected client will have a SVRCONN channel running on its behalf. It is possible to have many thousands of these channels running into a single Queue Manager.
- The client must be able to identify which channel it should use to communicate with the queue manager
